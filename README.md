# KCD2 Mod Conflict Checker

This is a simple program built in C# that iterates through your mods, both locally installed and those installed from the Steam Workshop, and checks for conflicting files, allowing you to easily discover which of your mods are conflicting with each other. Note that this should be used as a rough guide, and not all mods with conflicting files will be completely incompatible with one another.

Completely portable, no installation or prerequisites. Download, extract, run.

Please leave a comment if you encounter any bugs/have any suggestions.
